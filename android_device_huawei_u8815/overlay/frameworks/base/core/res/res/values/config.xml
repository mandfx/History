    <!-- Boolean indicating whether the wifi chipset supports background scanning mechanism.
         This mechanism allows the host to remain in suspend state and the dongle to actively
         scan and wake the host when a configured SSID is detected by the dongle. This chipset
         capability can provide power savings when wifi needs to be always kept on. -->
